# Inhuman-Resources PoC Build
CIS 410, Spring 2021
Jared Knofczynski, Megan Walter, Audra McNamee

Contributions:
Jared: Asset placement, agent movement & prefab design, overarching game logic, project architecting, and sound design.
Megan: Level design, rigidbody design elements.
Audra: PoC document, asset creation, narrative scripting, menus.

Deviations from Proposal:
Thus far we have not significantly deviated from our project proposal, nor are we currently planning toâ€” we are considering adding some story elements as a transition between levels, as well as some as some additional game-feel aspects, but we left space in our proposal to explore this throughout the development process.
